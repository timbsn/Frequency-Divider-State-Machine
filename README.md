# Frequency-Divider-State-Machine
This Parallax Assembly language and PBasic project was originally developed for a MicroChip Pic 16c84 and Basic Stamp 2. The Basic Stamp 2 provided a serial interface between the Pics and a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) consisting of a 4-row LCD with 6 buttons and 2 lights. Users would enter a percentage for each stepper motor output to track the input signal.

An encoder coupled to a machine's main drive motor supplied the input pulses for the system. The output frequency of the board fed a stepper motor driver, which then drove a mechanical unit. The program execution time permitted operation up into the 100kHz range.
