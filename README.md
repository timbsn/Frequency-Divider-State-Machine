# Frequency-Divider-State-Machine
This Parallax Assembly language and PBasic project was originally developed for a MicroChip Pic 16c84 and Basic Stamp 2. It is a proportional output state machine suitable to drive stepper motors into the 100kHz range. The Basic Stamp 2 provides an operator interface consisting of a 4-row LCD with 6 buttons and 2 lights. The Basic Stamp communicates with the PICs using a proprietary handshake and serial communications.

Users enter a percentage/density for each stepper motor/knitting head into the HMI.
